> **WARNING**: Be careful using this plugin in problematic worlds like CaveBlock or cave-generated worlds, as they can cause server crashes. It is **strongly recommended** to blacklist these worlds in the configuration.
> 
> **TIP**: For smoother teleportation, consider preloading chunks within your configured teleport distance using [Chunky](https://github.com/pop4959/Chunky) or similar chunk preloading tools.

## Technical Details

### Smart Surface Detection
The plugin uses intelligent terrain scanning instead of arbitrary Y-level checking:
- **Height Range**: Scans from Y=120 down to Y=32 (covers 99% of terrain)
- **Surface Finding**: Locates the actual highest solid block at each X,Z coordinate
- **Performance**: Much faster than scanning from world max height

### Asynchronous Operation
- **Chunk Loading**: Uses `getChunkAtAsync()` to prevent server crashes
- **Location Search**: Runs on async threads to avoid blocking main server thread
- **Thread Safety**: Properly handles Bukkit's thread safety requirements
- **Timeout Protection**: Built-in timeouts prevent infinite waiting

### Player Positioning
- **Surface Placement**: Players are teleported to Y+1 (on top of blocks)
- **No Embedding**: Prevents players from being placed inside blocks
- **Collision Safe**: Ensures proper player positioning for all teleportations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Plugin fails to find safe locations:**
- Increase `max-attempts` in config
- Check `safe-blocks` list includes common terrain blocks
- Verify world generation is working properly
- Consider adjusting `safety.strictness` (lower = more strict, higher = more lenient)

**Server lag during teleportation:**
- Ensure `async-teleport-search: true` is enabled
- Reduce `max-attempts` if needed
- Check server performance settings

**Chunk loading errors:**
- Verify server has sufficient RAM
- Check if world generation is enabled
- Ensure proper server permissions

### Performance Tips
- **Normal worlds**: Default settings work well
- **Complex terrain**: Increase `max-attempts` to 75-100
- **Cave worlds**: Set `safety.strictness` to 4-5 for more lenient placement, BUT HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO BLOCK THESE WORLDS.
- **High-traffic servers**: Keep `max-attempts` moderate (50-75) to balance success rate and performance
