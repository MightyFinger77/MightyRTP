# Random teleporter distance (border limit)
# This keeps players within ±distance blocks from world center (0,0)
# Set to -1 to disable border limit
# Set to "CUSTOM" to use pre-set teleport spots (use /rtp-set to add spots, must set spots for each enabled world)
teleport-distance: 5000

# Minimum distance from world center (0,0 or preset /rtp-center) (prevents teleporting too close to center)
min-distance-from-spawn: 200

# Cooldown settings. Users with mightyrtp.bypass ignore this feature.
cooldown:
  # Enable/disable the cooldown system
  enabled: true
